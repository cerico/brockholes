Users should also be able to rate trails, and the trail page should show the average rating the trail has, so lets set that up. First of all, lets get add in 5 font-awesome stars, and we can re use the addFav function we set up previously for users to mark trails as favourites or as completed

and we can pass that here in lines 107 and 108, which we can then PUT or POST to the server,

and apply an ng-class to the font-awesome star to show it orange if true

{% highlight html%}
        <i ng-repeat="star in stars" ng-class="{true: 'fa fa-star un', false: 'fa fa-star starred'}[star.grey]" ng-click="rateTrail(star.index)"></i>
        {% endhighlight%}
        
        
{% highlight javascript%}
$scope.changeStar = function(f) {
  $scope.stars = []
  for (var i=0;i<5;i++){
    $scope.stars.push({grey:i >= f, index:i+1});
    console.log($scope.stars)
  }
}
{% endhighlight%}

here, we can set up 5 stars as part of an ng-repeat, receiving the rating as 'f'. 5 stars are always pushed into the array, and for any number of above rating 'f', the star has a value of grey, and in the ng-repeat, if the value of grey is true, the font-awesome star is unstarred, the rest of the stars are orange, so its actually calculating the unstarred not the starred


We can then set up a function to calculate the average rating of the trail, iterating through the bookmarks, and if a rating attribute is found, calculating an average, this can then be passed into the scope as trailrating and ratedby, to show both the average rating, and the number of users who have rated it

Returning to our Rails Controller, we currently have the rating for a newly updated trail a a direct attribute of the Trail model, which we now want to change to be an attribute of the Bookmark model, so we should have a newly created Trail automatically create a bookmark for the uploader, automatically setting it as a favourite, but also adding the trails first rating to the bookmark object

and we can add in the user_id at the rails level rather than having it come in as part of the form
