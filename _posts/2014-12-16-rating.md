Users should also be able to rate trails, and the trail page should show the average rating the trail has, so lets set that up. First of all, lets get add in 5 font-awesome stars, and we can re use the addFav function we set up previously for users to mark trails as favourites or as completed

and we can pass that here in lines 107 and 108, which we can then PUT or POST to the server,

and apply an ng-class to the font-awesome star to show it orange if true

We can then set up a function to calculate the average rating of the trail, iterating through the bookmarks, and if a rating attribute is found, calculating an average, this can then be passed into the scope as trailrating and ratedby, to show both the average rating, and the number of users who have rated it

Returning to our Rails Controller, we currently have the rating for a newly updated trail a a direct attribute of the Trail model, which we now want to change to be an attribute of the Bookmark model, so we should have a newly created Trail automatically create a bookmark for the uploader, automatically setting it as a favourite, but also adding the trails first rating to the bookmark object

But at the moment we still don't have a user_id for the trail, to show who uploaded it. Originally I was going to use the GON gem for this, but as we're passing the current_user details as part of the trails data, we can access it that way. Ive put the application layout under a Layout controller, which returns all the trails (and the current_user via Active Model Serializer)

The trail page inherits currentuser from the layout controller, because it is now a child controller , and can be passed as a hidden value as part of the form
