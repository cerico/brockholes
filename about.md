This is a small blog, detailing the building of my app, [scenic](http://scenic.apps.salterhebble.com), for finding and creating hiking trails. Its written primarily for my own benefit to help me learn. The blog is written with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), using a theme from [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com) and hosted on [GithubPages](https://pages.github.com/).
